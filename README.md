# A Deep Understanding of Deep Learning — Notes & Code (Udemy Course)

This repository contains my personal notes, code implementations, code-challenges, and mini-projects from the Udemy course **“A Deep Understanding of Deep Learning (with Python Intro)”** by **Mike X Cohen**.

My goal is to build a strong, intuitive understanding of deep learning — not just how to use the APIs, but *why* things work the way they do, the math behind the models, and how to reason about architectures, optimization, and training dynamics.

## 🎯 Course Focus

This course is designed to teach deep learning from first principles using a **scientific, experimental approach**. It emphasizes:

- The theory and math behind deep learning  
- Intuition through visualizations  
- Understanding neural network mechanisms  
- PyTorch-based implementations  
- Lots of coding exercises & code-challenges  
- Real experiments to study model behavior  
- Learning best practices like regularization, metaparameters, normalization, and weight initialization  
- CNNs, Autoencoders, RNNs, GANs, Transfer Learning, Style Transfer  
- Hands-on milestone projects  


This structure will grow as I progress through the course.
